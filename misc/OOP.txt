Inheritance: inherit attributes and methods from one class to another
	- subclass (child): the class that inherits from another class
	- superclass (parent): the class being inherited from

Encapsulation: wrappoing up of data under a single unit
	- private/public methods and variables

Polymorphism: the ability of an object to take on many forms
	e.g. parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object

	** All java objects are polymorphic because they are of their own type and the Object type

	public interface Vegetarian{}
	public class Animal{}
	public class Deer extends Animal implements Vegetarian{}

	Deer d = new Deer();
	Animal a = d;
	Vegetarian v = d;
	Object o = d;
